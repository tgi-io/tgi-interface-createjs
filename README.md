CreateJS Interface http://createjs.com/

# TODO Now
- sounds ending with numbers get turned into broken folders
- lib is still not split from core
- fuck with physics
- keep shift drag from jumping on first move
- have gulp make assets with dependency

# TODO Later
- panels need setting for background tick frequency - manage in panel changes to have only one active (event?)
- toggle buttons - example sound pause - use in navs
- fix delay in touch on cell phones
- google fonts loaded after initial render (wrong font flicker)
- todo (node fix) delayed load until interface started (otherwise CreateJSInterface._createjs undefined)
- follow up with panel destroy ability to clear listeners
